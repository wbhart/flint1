=== general stuff ===

 * try GREDC algorithm
  
 * we should be checking somewhere (at build time?) that FLINT_BITS
   really is the same as GMP's bits per limb

 * cache hints:
    * add some documentation for cache hint macros in flint.h
    * instead of having loops like 
             for (j = 0; j < x->n; j += 8) FLINT_PREFETCH(x->coeffs[i+8], j);
      everywhere, can't we have a FLINT_BLOCK_PREFETCH macro?
 
 * determine cache size at build time, instead of #defined in flint.h!!!!
     * possibly determine size of each cache in hierarchy?
 
 * Collect together timing statistics on various programs (MAGMA, NTL, PARI,
FLINT, etc), in one convenient place. (David)

 * Write an asymptotically fast GCD algorithm for the Z package for very
large integers. (First check how far along the GMP implementation is, and
compare it speedwise to MAGMA (which presumably is very fast :-) )

 * follow up issue related to arithmetic right shifts --- see NTL's #define for 
   this. Add test code to the build process to check for this.

 * write threadsafe limb allocator 

=== fft ===

* GMP has a cool idea for doing very long butterflies. Instead of doing
a call to mpn_add_n and mpn_sub_n separately, it works in chunks to ensure
everything is done in cache. This will only make a difference when the
coefficients are so large they don't even fit in L1 any more. To do this
*properly* it would need to work for rotations as well.

* Is there a way to do reduce_mod_p_exact with one pass over the data in the
worst case? (Currently the worst case is two passes.)

* study the the overflow bit guarantees more carefully in the
  inverse transform. The cross butterflies seem to add a factor of 3 rather
  than 2 to the errors. Currently we are being too conservative in doing
  fast reductions; we could get away with fewer, but would need to do a
  safety reduction pass over the data after a certain number of layers.

* maybe it's not optimal to store the coefficients n+1 limbs apart. Bill
mentioned some potential cache-thrashing issues on intels. Might be better
to add a bit of padding.

=== fmpz_poly module ===

* for KS, try the idea where we evaluate X1 = f(2^n)g(2^n), X2 = f(-2^n)g(-2^n) 
  and then reconstruct output from X1+X2 and X1-X2

* It seems a little nuts to be using ZmodF_poly with a single coefficient
  in _fmpz_poly_mul_KS(). There's something wrong with the code structure here.
  The bitpacking etc routines need to be abstracted differently or something.
  -- david

* we should change the name of ABS() in fmpz_poly. This will certainly interfere
  with someone else's namespace one day. -- david

=== modpmul module (branch) ===

* try writing assembly version of mul_redc. Maybe the three multiplications
can be pipelined. Also, it might be possible to write a version which does
two independent multiplications in parallel, and gets some pipelining
happening that way. But that would require rewriting FFTs to take advantage
of it.

* consider writing a radix-4 or split-radix FFT. I don't understand these too
well, but it seems like these only give a speedup on "complex" data. There
was a paper Bill mentioned that simulates a "complex" FFT by working over
GF(p^2), so perhaps this could be used.

* see whether doing two FFT's at once saves time on computing roots of unity
and whether the multiplications being data independent might allow them to be
interleaved and thus overlapped due to pipelining on the Opteron.

* try to speed up basecase matrix transposition code

* examine NTL's modmuls more carefully. Benchmark just the modmuls by
themselves.

* think about the ordering of loops in each stage of the outer fft routine.
Sometimes might be slightly better to start at the end and work backwards
to improve locality.


=== ZmodF module ===

* in revision 507, I rewrote ZmodF_mul_2exp(). For long coefficients the new
  version should be more efficient, since it does fewer passes over the data
  on average. But this needs to be checked. Moreover it's quite possible the
  new version is slower for small coefficients, which also needs to be
  investigated.


=== ZmodF_poly module ===

* reorganise code to permit doing pointwise mults + inner FFTs + inner IFFTs 
  with better locality


=== ZmodF_mul module ===

* for squaring, we don't need to allocate so much memory  


=== Miscellaneous ===

  bit machines)
